# Pactum

Pactum is a fork of [Imperial](https://github.com/vapor-community/Imperial) that extends the original OAuth2 functionality to fully support OpenID Connect (OIDC). This allows seamless integration with identity providers using the OIDC standard, building on top of the reliable OAuth2 implementation provided by Imperial.

# Features:

- Full support for OAuth2 authentication and authorization flows.
- Integration with major identity providers using OpenID Connect.
